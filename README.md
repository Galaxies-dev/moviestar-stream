# Moviestar Livestream

Check out the [full Livestream on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_Smo78tv8Y&ab_channel=SimonGrimm).

## What is this?

This is the repository for the Livestream on my YouTube channel. In this Livestream I am building a Movie App with React Native and the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

## How to use this repository?

Just run `npm install` to install all dependencies and then `expo prebuild` to create the native projects.

Then run `expo run:ios` or `expo run:android` to start the app.
